def optimize_tracker_angles(angles):
    """Optimize the angles of the tracker for each time to maximize efficiency. Uses solar irradiance data, angle of incidence, and other factors to decide when to rotate the tracker or keep it stationary. Updates the DataFrame with the optimized angles for each time.

    Args:
        angles (pandas.Series): dict or DataFrame with the following columns:
            * `tracker_theta`: The rotation angle of the tracker is a right-handed
            rotation defined by `roof_heading`.
            tracker_theta = 0 is horizontal. [degrees]
            * `aoi`: The angle-of-incidence of direct irradiance onto the
            rotated panel surface. [degrees]
            * `surface_tilt`: The angle between the panel surface and the earth
            surface, accounting for panel rotation. [degrees]
            * `surface_azimuth`: The azimuth of the rotated panel, determined by
            projecting the vector normal to the panel's surface to the earth's
            surface. [degrees]

    Returns:
    pandas.DataFrame: The optimized angles of the tracker for each time.
